In this implementation i used a Deep Q Network (DQN) to solve the bannana collector enviroment. The enviroment used The objective of the enviroment is to be used as a playground to train an agent that is capable of traveling through a world picking up yellow bananas and avoiding blue bannanas. Each time the agent picks up a yellow bannana a reward of +1 is provided, and each time the agent picks up a blue bannana a reard of -1 is provided aswell. In this manner, the objective of the agent is to pick up as many yellow bannanas as possible whilst avoiding the blue bannanas. The enviroment consist of a grid world of 37 states and contains the agents forward velocity, along a ray-based perception of objects around the agents forward direction. Additionally, the agent is only capable of choosing 4 discrete actions: Forward, Backward, turn left and turn right. The solving this enviroment is an episodic task, and is considered to be solved once the agent reaches and average score during 100 episodes of +13 or more.
