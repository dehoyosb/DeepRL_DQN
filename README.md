Reinforcement Learning Application

In this repository it's shown the usage of a Deep Reinforcement Tecnique called DQN or Deep Q Network, which uses the concepts of Reinforcement Learning applied and used with a Deep Neural Network as a Function Approximator to map state space to action space, to solve the Bannana Collection Enviroment.
